# JavaScript Calculator

JavaScript Calculator is the fourth project for the *Front End Development Libraries* course that is hosted by **FreeCodeCamp**.
It utilizes the **React** JavaScript library to build the UI. The user can press the buttons in the calculator to make
simple calculations. The display above will show both the formula during the calculation and the most recent input.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is a part of **FreeCodeCamp** *Front End Development Libraries Course*. Their example project has been used for inspiration and the
constraints of the test criteria set a foundation on which my vision was built.
